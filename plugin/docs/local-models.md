# Local models: drop / picker loading

A local `.nam` file, an IR `.wav`, or a folder of them loads as a local
block, no browser or account involved: dropped on a tile, or picked via the
tile context menus' **Load File / Load Folder** (a native OS file dialog).
The design goal is that local files are a second-class *entry point*, not a
second-class block: once in, they ride the exact catalog pipeline
(background load, in-memory model cache, undo, duplication, presets, DAW
state), and the code branches on "local" in only a handful of places.

Entry points: both the drop and the picker land in
`plugin/ui/services/LocalFiles` (`drop` / `pick`), which hands a path to
`TONE3000Processor::loadLocalTonePath` in
`plugin/src/ProcessorModelLoader.cpp` (on iOS, security-scoped URLs to
`loadLocalToneUrls`; see `docs/ios.md`). Behavior is pinned by
`test/src/local_load_tests.cpp`, which drives the byte-array sibling
`loadLocalTone` ({ name, base64 data } entries: the shape the UI used before
it had file paths, kept because the tests feed files that way).

## Drop and picker

Dropping a file or folder onto a tile (`juce::FileDragAndDropTarget` on the
gallery tiles) and right-clicking a tile for **Load File** / **Load Folder**
(a native `juce::FileChooser`) are the same route with two front doors: an
insert slot adds, a tone tile swaps in place.

`loadLocalTonePath` reads the bytes straight from disk. A folder is walked
recursively; the majority extension decides NAM vs IR, the folder name
becomes the tone title, and each file becomes one model named after it
(300 files / 50 MB each max, matching the catalog's per-tone model limit,
in natural name order). A single file must be `.nam` or `.wav` and is titled
from its name.

Each file is validated at load time (`.nam` must parse and pass the A2
shape check, `.wav` must open as real audio) so a bad file is a toast, never
a retry badge. Survivors are stashed (below) and wrapped in a synthetic tone
JSON: `id: 0`, `local: true`, and each model's `model_url` pointing at its
stash copy with a `file://` URL. From there `loadTone` takes over, and
`fetchModelFromUrl` resolves `file://` URLs from disk instead of the
network.

While a file is open for validation, its gear is inferred best-effort so a
lane of local tiles isn't a row of identical file glyphs: a `.nam`'s
`metadata.gear_type` (free text written by the trainer; only the common
spellings map, e.g. `amp` / `pedal_amp` / `preamp` → `amp`, `amp_cab` →
`amp-cab`, `studio` → `outboard`) and, for an IR, cab length (at or under
the short/long cutoff → `cab`). The result is the same catalog `gear` id a
TONE3000 tone carries, set on the tone from its first file; when nothing
matches, `gear` is simply absent and the tile keeps the generic file glyph
(`ToneImage`).

The picker isn't sugar: it covers users who never think to drag-drop, works
signed out, and is the only route on iOS (the Files app has no drag into
the plugin). Drops work on every desktop platform, Linux included; the old
web UI never received them there because XDnD died at the embedded
WebKitGTK view
([issue #22](https://github.com/tone-3000/tone3000-plugin/issues/22)), one
of the reasons the UI is native.

## One stored model list, one exception

Catalog tones store only the *active* model natively; the picker pages the
full catalog from the API. Local tones have no API, so their model list is
the dropped files and stays whole in the stored tone JSON:
`parseToneForLoading` and `switchModel` skip their pruning for local tones,
and the tone summary ships each local model's `model_url` so the picker can
drive switches (which also work signed out; nothing downloads).

## The stash

`<app-data>/TONE3000/LocalModels/<content-hash>-<size>.<ext>` is the local
equivalent of "the server": the copy that cache-lost reloads (undo after a
remove, retry) re-fetch from, stable even after the user's original file
moves. Content-addressed names dedupe re-drops.

Its lifecycle is self-maintaining:

- **Liveness is mtime.** Every use re-stamps the file: stash writes, reads
  in `fetchModelFromUrl`, and cache-hit loads via `refreshLocalStashCopy`.
- **GC.** `cleanLocalModelStash` (once per process, off-thread) deletes
  stash files unused for a week. Clearing on startup would be wrong:
  instances in other processes may still hold undo history that references
  the files by path.
- **The name is the address.** A block's `model_url` persists the stash
  path absolutely, in presets, DAW/app state and undo snapshots. Reads go
  back through `resolveLocalModelFile`, which falls back to the same file
  name under the *current* stash root when the stored path is gone. A path
  this machine wrote always still exists, so desktop loads are untouched; the
  one desktop case it changes is a preset or state carrying a stash URL from
  another machine, which now re-stashes locally from the embedded bytes
  instead of reading the embedded cache alone. It is what keeps iOS working:
  the app data container's UUID rotates on every reinstall or app update.
- **Self-healing.** Presets and DAW state embed the model bytes
  (`ModelCache`), so they reopen without the stash, on any machine. When
  such a load hits the embedded cache and the stash copy is missing (GC'd,
  or a different machine), `refreshLocalStashCopy` writes it back, so undo
  and retry keep working there too.
- **A writable root, even after damage.** The app-data folder can exist
  without being writable: a sudo'd run of an older `install-plugin.sh`
  (it wrote the user Factory folder, and macOS sudo keeps `$HOME`) or a
  restored backup leaves it root-owned, and every stash write then failed as
  "Couldn't store the dropped file" while reads kept working
  ([issue #76](https://github.com/tone-3000/tone3000-plugin/issues/76)).
  `ensureWritableDir` (constructor, once per process, plus the stash and
  preset write paths) puts the write bits back in place when the user still
  owns the folder; otherwise it renames the folder aside to an `.unwritable`
  sibling (the parent belongs to the user even when the folder doesn't) and
  recreates it fresh. Nothing is deleted, and the log names what it did.
