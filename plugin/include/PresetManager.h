/**
 * On-disk internal preset store. Pure file layer: one preset per file (the
 * framing lives in PresetFile.h), no knowledge of what a preset contains
 * (the processor builds/consumes the payloads). Message-thread only for
 * writes.
 *
 * Layout:
 *   <user data dir>/TONE3000/Presets/<Name>.t3kpreset    (user presets)
 *   <user data dir>/TONE3000/Presets/Factory/…           (read-only factory)
 *   <system data dir>/TONE3000/Presets/Factory/…         (installer-shipped)
 *
 * The system Factory folder is where installers drop shipped presets
 * (macOS /Library/Application Support, Windows ProgramData); on iOS there is
 * no installer, so it is FactoryPresets inside the app bundle. Both Factory
 * dirs are scanned; a user-Factory file with the same id wins so local
 * overrides of a shipped preset are possible.
 *
 * Identity vs. filename. A preset's identity is the "id" property inside
 * the file (a uuid minted on first save); the filename is a *view* of its
 * display name, sanitized so the same file is valid on macOS, Windows,
 * Linux and iOS (presetfile::sanitizeStem), with " 2", " 3", … appended on
 * a collision. Ids are exposed as "user:<id>" / "factory:<id>" so the two
 * namespaces can never collide and the UI can tell them apart without extra
 * lookups. Because identity lives inside, renames (which rename the file)
 * and users shuffling files in Finder/Explorer never break the ids stored in
 * order.json or as activePresetId inside DAW projects.
 *
 * Legacy files (pre-readable-names) are named <uuid>.t3kpreset and carry no
 * "id"; their id is the filename stem, which is the same uuid, so every id
 * ever handed out keeps resolving. Migration is lazy: the next save-over or
 * rename of such a preset writes the stem in as its "id", rewrites it in
 * the v2 framing and renames the file to its display name. Files with no
 * "id" and a readable stem (a user renamed one by hand) work the same way.
 *
 * Cost model. list() rescans the directories on every call so multiple
 * plugin instances sharing the folder stay coherent for free. A rescan is
 * a directory listing plus one stat() per file: id and name are cached per
 * file, keyed on (mtime, size), and a changed/new file costs one *header*
 * read (a few hundred bytes; PresetFile.h) rather than deserializing the
 * megabytes of model bytes it embeds. Only legacy v1 files need a full
 * parse, once. This matters because hosts drive list() at editor open
 * (Reaper asks for all 128 program names every time, GitHub issue #169),
 * and the cache is per plugin instance, so every instance's first call in
 * a session is cold.
 *
 * Ordering: user presets always come before factory presets (the browser's
 * two sections; a player's own presets own the low MIDI program-change
 * numbers). Within each section a custom order can be set via move() and
 * persists in order.json beside the preset files; presets not in the order
 * file (new saves, first run) fall back to name order after the ordered
 * ones. List order is user-facing truth: the browser, prev/next stepping
 * and MIDI program-change numbers all follow it.
