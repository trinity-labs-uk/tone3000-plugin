/**
 * Zero-latency noise gate for the input stage.
 *
 * The faceplate carries the threshold (the Gate knob); its advanced panel
 * exposes the three behaviours that shape how a gate sounds once it has
 * decided to close (release, hold, range; see Params). Everything else is
 * fixed, tuned for guitar/bass sources:
 *
 *  - Sidechain detector: gating decisions are made from a band-passed copy
 *    of the signal (12 dB/oct highpass at 80 Hz, 6 dB/oct lowpass at 5 kHz)
 *    so mains hum can't hold the gate open and broadband hiss can't trigger
 *    it. The audible path is never filtered.
 *  - Peak envelope follower with a fast rise and a slower fall, so the
 *    detector reacts to pick attacks instantly but rides note decay smoothly
 *    instead of chattering on waveform ripple.
 *  - Hysteresis + hold: the gate opens at the threshold but only starts
 *    closing once the envelope has spent the whole hold time below a second
 *    threshold 5 dB lower. Palm mutes and staccato playing can hover around
 *    the knob setting without open/close flutter.
 *  - Downward-expander close: a closing gate never slams to silence. The
 *    target gain tracks the decaying envelope cubically (a 4:1 expander
 *    curve) down to the range floor, so note tails fade naturally instead of
 *    being cut. The same curve eases the gate open as the envelope
 *    approaches the threshold from below - a soft knee for free.
 *  - Gain smoothing: ~0.2 ms attack and a release one-pole ramp. The
 *    near-instant attack is what makes zero lookahead viable: the gate is
 *    fully open before a pick transient develops. Attack is deliberately
 *    not a user control: on a zero-lookahead guitar gate a slower attack
 *    only ever clips pick transients.
 *
 * No lookahead and no internal buffering - zero added latency, safe for
 * live monitoring. Channels (up to 2) are fully independent: in stereo mode
 * the two lanes may carry different instruments, and for mono/duplicated
 * sources identical inputs produce identical gains anyway.
 *
 * Threading: prepare()/reset() from prepareToPlay, setParams() and
 * process() from the audio thread. process() allocates nothing and costs a
 * handful of multiplies per sample. Denormals are handled by the caller's
 * ScopedNoDenormals.
