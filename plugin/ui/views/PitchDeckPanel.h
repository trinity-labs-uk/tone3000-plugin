// The pitch group's advanced panel (right-click the group; touch-and-hold
// the knob): the settings behind the semitone knob.
//  - STEP: on (the default), the knob detents to whole semitones and the
//    processor rounds the shift, so automation snaps too (a transpose);
//    off, the knob sweeps smoothly (Shift-drag for fine control) like a
//    whammy pedal. Same chrome as the EQ card's PRE toggle.
//  - Tonality: the frequency above which the input bypasses the shifter
//    (1-20 kHz, log), so pick attack and fret noise keep their brightness
//    while the notes move. Off (the top) is a pure shift.
//  - Buffer: the engine's delay buffer, four detents (20/30/40/60 ms). The
//    lowest note it holds a full period of, and how often it splices; the
//    latency it reports to the host is half of it plus 1 ms. Attacks always
//    pass in a few ms whatever the buffer.
// Plain controls, no power switches, same footprint as the gate deck so the
// two read as one family.
