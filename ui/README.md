# TONE3000 Plugin UI

React + TypeScript frontend for the TONE3000 plugin. The build output goes to
`../plugin/webview/`, where CMake embeds it as JUCE binary data and the plugin
serves it in a native WebView (WebView2 on Windows, WebKit elsewhere).

## Development

`@juce-framework/webview` is a `file:` dependency on the JUCE tree under
`../libs/juce`. That directory is created by CMake configure, so from the
repo root run `cmake -B build -S .` **before** `npm install` (Linux: also
pass `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/linux-toolchain.cmake`). See the root
README Quick start.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev        # Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # typecheck + build into ../plugin/webview
npm run lint       # eslint
npm run format     # prettier
```

`VITE_T3K_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is optional. Without it, enter a `t3k_pub_…`
publishable key from your TONE3000 account in Plugin Settings and register
`juce://juce.backend/index.html` as its redirect URI. The key identifies the
OAuth client; each person signs in to their own TONE3000 account. Artemis
builds embed the value from `ui/.env` when supplied. With no key, the first
sign-in action opens the Plugin Settings key field directly.

The dev server is useful for layout and TONE3000 browsing work, but anything
that calls into the plugin (parameters, chain state, meters) needs the real
JUCE backend, so the usual loop is `npm run build` followed by a plugin build.

The bundle must stay runnable on old system WebKits (macOS 10.15 is Safari
13-15 era, Linux WebKitGTK varies by distro), so `vite.config.ts` pins
`build.target` low; don't raise it casually. If the UI ever fails to boot,
the watchdog in `index.html` writes the reason to the plugin's native log.

## How it talks to the plugin

`@juce-framework/webview` (from the JUCE tree in `../libs`) provides three
primitives, wrapped by `src/backend/JuceBackend.ts`:

- **Parameters**: slider/toggle/combo state bound to APVTS parameters, used
  through `src/hooks/useParameter.ts`.
- **Native functions**: request/response calls into C++ (registered in
  `plugin/src/EditorWebViewSetup.cpp`), used through
  `src/hooks/useFunction.ts`.
- **Events**: pushed from C++ (chain updates, meters, tuner frames).

The native side is the source of truth. React holds UI-only state; anything
persistent lives in the processor and comes back through events or getters.

## TONE3000 integration

`src/t3k/tone3000-client.ts` is the API client (adapted from the
[TONE3000 API examples](https://github.com/tone-3000/api)). The select/login
flows are OAuth 2.0 + PKCE and run in the same WebView as the UI: we navigate
to the authorize URL, TONE3000 redirects back to `index.html?code=...`, React
remounts and exchanges the code, then hands the access token to native via
`setAccessToken` so C++ downloads can send `Authorization: Bearer` headers.
Session logic lives in `src/hooks/useToneSession.ts`, and the add/swap tone
flows in `src/hooks/useToneLoadFlow.ts`. The same hook handles local files
dropped on a tile (`.nam` / IR `.wav`, or a folder of them); the tile menus'
Load File / Load Folder rows load the same files through a native picker
instead. Both routes load natively with no browser or auth; see
[`plugin/docs/local-models.md`](../plugin/docs/local-models.md).

## Layout

| Path              | Contents                                             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/components/` | UI components; `Plugin.tsx` is the root orchestrator |
| `src/hooks/`      | Parameter, chain, session, and utility hooks         |
| `src/backend/`    | The JUCE bridge                                      |
| `src/t3k/`        | TONE3000 API client and config                       |
| `src/types/`      | Shared types and ambient declarations                |

Styling is inline styles with shared design tokens in
`src/components/theme.ts`; global resets live in `src/index.css`.

Every length is authored in `rem` against a 1024x578 design space:
`useUiScale` keeps the root font-size at `scale`px (the design box fitted to
the actual viewport, letterboxed; below 1x when the viewport is smaller than
the box), so `1rem` is exactly one design px at the current window scale and
the whole UI tracks the window proportionally. Write new dimensions as
`rem` strings (or `rem(n)` from `hooks/useUiScale` for computed values);
raw `px` is only for real viewport coordinates (pointer positions, rect
math), which must be multiplied by `getUiScale()` before mixing with
design-space numbers.
